# Project Overview

This project is a web application built using Next.js and TypeScript, designed to facilitate interactions between users and vendors. It includes features for user authentication, product management, order processing, and geolocation services.

## Key Components

1. **User Management**:
   - **User Model**: Handles user data, including username, email, password, and verification status.
   - **Vendor Model**: Similar to the user model but tailored for vendors, including business-related fields.
   - **Authentication**: Middleware to manage user sessions and redirect based on user roles.

2. **Product Management**:
   - **Product Model**: Defines the structure for product data, including name, description, price, and stock.
   - **APIs**: Endpoints for adding, updating, and retrieving products.

3. **Order Processing**:
   - **Order Model**: Manages order details, including user information, products ordered, and order status.
   - **Cart Model**: Keeps track of products added to the user's cart.

4. **Geolocation Services**:
   - **Location Utility**: Fetches the user's current location and retrieves additional data using an external API.

5. **Frontend Structure**:
   - The application is organized into components and pages, following Next.js conventions for routing and layout.

## Conclusion

This project is designed to provide a seamless experience for users and vendors, with robust data management and user-friendly interfaces. The use of modern technologies like Next.js and TypeScript ensures scalability and maintainability.
